<h4>Testimonials</h4>
I am 88 years old, have two artificial knees, two artificial hips, have been playing 4 years, and I love the game. I played tennis for decades, but I lost all my partners when they died or went to retirement homes. Since pickleball is played on much smaller courts than tennis, I can still maneuver to hit the ball. – Tom

I was originally told that Pickleball was a great way to get my father-in-law out and active with other athletic seniors. After my first time out, I was instantly addicted and find myself playing about 3+ times per week. I have since introduced it to my wife, daughter (11 yrs old) and a few of my friends. This has been a great sport to learn with my wife, daughter and father-in-law. Everyone has a great time and we love the people we meet. I can’t believe how much fun we all have and how quickly everyone picked up the basics. - Mark
