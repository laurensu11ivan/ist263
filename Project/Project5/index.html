        <li>Pickleball was invented in 1965 on Bainbridge Island, a short ferry ride from Seattle, Washington. Three dads – Joel Pritchard, Bill Bell, and Barney McCallum who made it to keep their children occupied over the summer are credited for creating game. Pickleball has evolved from original handmade equipment and simple rules into a popular sport throughout the US and Canada. The game is growing internationally as well, with many European and Asian countries adding courts.</li>

I am 88 years old, have two artificial knees, two artificial hips, have been playing 4 years, and I love the game. I played tennis for decades, but I lost all my partners when they died or went to retirement homes. Since pickleball is played on much smaller courts than tennis, I can still maneuver to hit the ball. <b>– Tom</b>

I was originally told that Pickleball was a great way to get my father-in-law out and active with other athletic seniors. After my first time out, I was instantly addicted and find myself playing about 3+ times per week. I have since introduced it to my wife, daughter (11 yrs old) and a few of my friends. This has been a great sport to learn with my wife, daughter and father-in-law. Everyone has a great time and we love the people we meet. I can’t believe how much fun we all have and how quickly everyone picked up the basics. <b>- Mark </b>
