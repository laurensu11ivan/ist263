    <h1> Understanding Scoring</h1>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Points are scored only on the serve; the receiving side cannot score a point.
            At the start of the game, the player on the right side (even court) serves to the diagonally opposite court. </li>
           <li>If a point is scored, the server moves to the left side (odd court) and serves to the diagonally opposite court.</li> 
            <li>Players on the serving side continue to move from the right to left or left to right each time a point is scored.</li>
            <li>Players on the serving team do not alternate sides unless a point is scored. The receiving side never alternates sides.</li>
            <li>The first server continues to serve until the serving team loses a rally by committing a fault; then the serve passes to the second server on the team.</li>
          <li>When the second server loses the serve, the serve goes to the other team and the player on the right serves first. That pattern continues throughout the game. Each team mate serves until they loose the point and then the other team serves</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Calling the Score</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>The score should be called as three numbers.</li>
        <li>Proper sequence for calling the score is: server score, receiver score, then, for doubles only, the server number: 1 or 2.</li>
        <li>To start a match, the score will be called as: zero - zero – two*</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to Score a Point</h3>
    <hr>
    <ul>
    <li>The Bounces twice on either size and the team who hit the ball over the net gets a point</li>
    <li>Out of bounds on serve or a hit </li>
    <li>Stepping into the Kitchen without the ball going into it</li>
    <li>Hitting the ball in the air if the ball has not been hit by each team once after a serve</li>
    <li>If you hit the person on the other team, the team that hit the ball over the net receives a point.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ending a Game</h4>
    <hr>
    <p>A game is finished when one player or team reaches 11 points and is leading by at least two points. If the score is tied at 10-10, then the game continues until one player or team wins by two points. Players switch sides after the first game if counting to play.</p>

    <h5>Starting a Game</h5>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start of each new game, only one player on the first serving team is allowed a service turn before giving up the ball to the opponents. Thereafter both members of each team will have a service turn before the ball is turned over to the opposing team.</li>
        <li>In doubles, the player on the right at the start of a service turn will be the first person to serve for their team and will continue to serve until he or she does not win a point. Then his or her partner will serve until he or she does also does not win a point. Then it is the other teams turn to serve. • When the serving team scores a point, the server moves to the other side of the serving team’s court. The receiving team should never switch sides.</li>
        <li>If the serve rotation is done properly in doubles, the serving team's score will always be even when the player that started the game on the right side is on the right side and odd when that player is on the left side.</li>

    </ul>
