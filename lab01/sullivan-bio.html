        Hi all! My name is Lauren Sullivan. I am a Retail Management and Supply Chain major with a minor in Information Management and Technology interested in pursuing a career in merchandising in the fashion industry. My largest accomplishment this far was having an internship at staples this past summer doing merchandising. I significantly used the skills I learned from being excel certified in this internship. Outside of school, I love to be outside, go to the beach, hang out with friends and golf. I also enjoy cooking and watching Americaâ€™s got talent. I live with my mother and father in Massachusetts and have an older sister who is 23.
