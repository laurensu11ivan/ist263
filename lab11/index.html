    <p>
        Hi all! My name is Lauren Sullivan. I am a 20 year old junior at Syracuse University. I am a Retail Management and Supply Chain major with a minor in Information Management and Technology interested in pursuing a career in merchandising in the fashion industry. My <strong>largest accomplishment</strong> this far was having an internship at staples this past summer doing merchandising. I significantly used the skills I learned from being excel certified in this internship.

        Outside of school, I love to be outside, go to the beach, hang out with friends and golf. I also enjoy cooking and watching America's got talent. I live with my mother and father in Massachusetts and have an older sister who is 23. My favorite things to do at my hosue in Masaschusetts are
