        Hi all! My name is Lauren Sullivan. I am a 20 year old junior at Syracuse University. I am a Retail Management and Supply Chain major with a minor in Information Management and Technology interested in pursuing a career in merchandising in the fashion industry. My <strong>largest accomplishment</strong> this far was having an internship at staples this past summer doing merchandising. I significantly used the skills I learned from being excel certified in this internship.
